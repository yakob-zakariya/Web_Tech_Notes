# Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework that helps developers build responsive and visually appealing websites and web applications. It provides a collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components and utilities that can be easily customized and integrated into projects.

Break points in bootstrap are the following:

| Breakpoint | Class infix | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extra small | None | <576px |
| Small | sm | ≥576px |
| Medium | md | ≥768px |
| Large | lg | ≥992px |
| Extra large | xl | ≥1200px |
| Extra extra large | xxl | ≥1400px |

containers are used to create a consistent and centered layout for the content of a web page. They provide a way to control the width and responsiveness of the page content within a fixed or fluid container.

There are two types of containers in Bootstrap: **`.container`** and **`.container-fluid`**.

1. **`.container`**: This class creates a fixed-width container that adapts its width based on the viewport size. The content inside a **`.container`** is centered horizontally on the page. It has predefined maximum widths for different breakpoints, ensuring that the layout remains responsive.
2. **`.container-fluid`**: This class creates a full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport. The content inside a **`.container-fluid`** extends to the edges of the screen. It adjusts its width dynamically as the viewport size changes.

## Bootstrap grid

the bootstrap grid divide our container in to 12 equal columns And we can use the prefixes

of the above containers to make our columns more responsive on different screen and sizes.
